        review: `A thrilling movie, albeit lackluster as far as characterization goes. 
        Its setpieces are fantastic and the visuals pay an homage to the original trilogy in amazing ways, 
        but the plot is limited by the pre-existing movies, so there are no surprises in store. 
        Overall, a fun, albeit shallow, adittion to the galaxy far, far away.`,
